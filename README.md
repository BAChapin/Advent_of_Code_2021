# Advent of Code - 2021

I will use this repository as my Advent of Code<sup>1</sup> (AoC) repo for the 2021 challenge. I'm changing how I am tackling the problems this year.

Firstly, instead of using Swift, I will be using Python 3.9 as my language of choice. I learned it this year, so I want to practice more with these challenges

Secondly, I will not be creating a server for the problems this year. I have been learning abotu Flask and Djanjo, but I don't feel comfortable enough with either to create it this year. And honestly, reverse engineering the challenges to give other randomized data sets took a decent amount of time for me to do.

Finally, this will be my only repo this year. Instead of having a repo for each day, I intend on organizing this single repo to support each day that I complete. I have added an organization section to explain that better.

## Get Involved

I have created a private leaderboard on Advent of Code for up to 199 people to join, feel free to jump in and play along. Each day solving the 2 challenges earning stars. The private leaderboard's join code is `1048725-41c081f6` Once the 199 spots have been filled I will remove this portion of the readme, and at the end of the month post the top 5 people on the leaderboard.

**Note:** _The leaderboard is retro-active, so if you've already done the days leading up to the day you join, your points will still count._
